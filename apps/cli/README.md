## ✨ What is Hanma?

**Hanma** is a specialized CLI engine designed to eliminate the tedious "boilerplate phase" of backend development. Inspired by tools like shadcn/ui but built for the **server-side**, Hanma doesn't provide a library; it provides **source code**.

### Why Hanma?

- **Zero Lock-in**: You own the code. Once added, it's just local files in your project. No runtime dependencies on Hanma.
- **Composable Architecture**: Mix and match templates. Need Express with Drizzle, Clerk Auth, and Socket.io? Hanma builds it for you.
- **Framework Aware**: Hanma understands whether you're using Express, Hono, or Elysia and adapts the code it gives you accordingly.
- **Production Grade**: Every snippet and module following industry best practices for security, types, and structure.

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

To get the most out of Hanma, it helps to understand the three types of code it provides:

### 1. Composable Templates (`create`)

Scaffolding a project isn't just picking a framework. It's picking a *stack*. The `create` command uses a composable engine that stitches together base frameworks with database ORMs, auth handlers, and middleware setups during initialization.

### 2. Modules (`module`)

A module is a complex, multi-file feature. Adding a "Better Auth" module doesn't just add one file; it adds routes, middleware, types, and schema files, ensuring everything is wired up correctly from the start.

### 3. Snippets (`add`)

The building blocks. Individual files or functions for specific tasks—CORS setup, JWT utilities, validation schemas, or custom error handlers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Start the interactive project builder
npx hanma create my-project

# Add a module to an existing project
cd my-project
npx hanma mod drizzle-postgres

# Inject a specific utility snippet
npx hanma add logger
```

## 📖 Detailed Command Reference

### `create [name]`

The entry point for new projects.

| Flag | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `--framework <fw>` | Force a specific framework (e.g., `express`, `hono`, `elysia`) |
| `--database <db>` | Pre-select database (e.g., `drizzle-postgres`, `prisma-mysql`) |
| `--auth <auth>` | Pre-select auth provider (e.g., `better-auth`, `clerk`, `jwt`) |
| `--pm <package-manager>` | Select package manager (only shows installed ones) |
| `--skip-install` | Scaffold only, don't run the installer |

> **Note:** The CLI automatically detects which package managers are installed on your system and only shows those as options.

### `add [snippets...]`

Smart snippet injection. Hanma reads your `hanma.json` to ensure you get the right code for your framework.

```bash
# Multi-select interactively (recommened)
hanma add

# Category filtered select
hanma add --category middleware
```

### `show <type> [name]`

The Discovery Engine. Browse the registry without leaving your terminal.

- `hanma show snippets`: List all snippets for your detected framework.
- `hanma show templates`: Browse the scaffolding library.
- `hanma show modules`: See complex multi-file features.
- `hanma show tooling`: Browse dev-tools configurations.

### `update`

Keep your CLI up to date.

```bash
# Check for updates
hanma update --check

# Update to latest version
hanma update
```

| Core Scaffolding | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 |
| Snippet Library | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Auth Modules | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 🚧 |
| DB Integrations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## ⚙️ How it Works: `hanma.json`

When you run `hanma init` or `hanma create`, a small configuration file is created. This is the **brain** of the CLI—it keeps Hanma "framework aware".

```json
{
  "framework": "express",
  "componentsPath": "src",
  "utilsPath": "src/utils"
}
```

- **Framework Awareness**: When you run `hanma add cors`, Hanma checks this file. If it's `express`, it fetches the Express middleware. If it's `hono`, it fetches the Hono version.
- **Custom Paths**: Tired of `src/`? Change `componentsPath` to `./lib` and Hanma will respect it.
