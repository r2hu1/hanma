    question: "What exactly is Hanma?",
    answer: "Hanma is not a framework or a library you install as a dependency. It is a collection of re-usable code snippets that you can copy and paste into your apps. You own the code."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it free to use?",
    answer: "Yes, the core components are open source and free to use in personal and commercial projects. We also offer a Pro plan for advanced enterprise modules."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I update components?",
    answer: "Since you own the code, updates are manual. However, we provide a CLI tool that can diff your local components against the latest version and help you patch changes."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you support microservices?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our components are designed to be modular. You can use our gRPC or RabbitMQ snippets to easily stitch together microservices."
